    # -a: Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.)
    # -v: Verbose (lists the files being transferred)
    # -h: Human-readable format for file sizes
    # --progress: Shows a progress bar for each file
    # --append-verify: Resumes transfers of partial files and verifies checksums after.
    #                  This is generally safer than just --append.
    # --delete: Deletes files from the destination if they no longer exist in the source.
